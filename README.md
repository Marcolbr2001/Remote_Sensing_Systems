# Remote_Sensing_Systems
Worked with remote sensors at system level, from signal acquisition to data processing. Performed FTIR calibration and atmospheric retrievals using Python, and implemented radar CFAR detection and SAR imaging with MATLAB using real data acquired from physical lab instrumentation.
